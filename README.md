## Hashing and Encryption

At All-in-One Keeper, we take data security very seriously. To safeguard your sensitive information, we implement both hashing and encryption techniques:

- Hashing: When you store your passwords in VaultLock, we hash them using strong and salted cryptographic algorithms. Hashing converts your plain-text passwords into irreversible hashed values, ensuring that even we, as service providers, cannot access your original passwords.

- Encryption/Decryption: Alongside hashing, we employ encryption techniques to secure your data at rest. Before storing your notes and Web Archive entries in the database, we encrypt them using robust encryption algorithms. When you need to view or edit this data, we decrypt it only for authorized users, enhancing data privacy and security.

## Our Values

1. **Security First**: We prioritize the security and privacy of your data above all else. Our commitment to using industry-leading encryption and authentication practices ensures your information remains safe from prying eyes.

2. **User-Centric Design**: Our user interface and experience are thoughtfully designed to offer a seamless and intuitive platform, making your journey with All-in-One Keeper enjoyable and efficient.

3. **Simplicity and Productivity**: We aim to simplify your digital life by providing an all-inclusive solution that empowers you to be more productive and organized.
